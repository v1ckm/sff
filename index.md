- What is the earliest time we can show up to the campgrounds?

The campgrounds do not open until noon on Friday. **Do not** show up before that time. **Do not** line up on the side of the freeway.

- What do we need before we can enter the campgrounds?

Tickets or ID. Screenshot/save the tickets prior to arrival since cell phone reception is spotty at best.

- What if this is our first time to camp?

Let the gate volunteers/attendents know you're new to see if they have any advice or guidance. Ask questions, don't be shy.

- Is there a burn ban?

Ask Ray. He loves that. There may also be a flag or symbol near the guard shack indicating that only Coleman/propane style lanterns, fire pits, stoves, burners, and alike are allowed. Open wood, charcoal, or any other type of fuel fires are not.
