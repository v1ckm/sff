## Camping

* **What is the earliest time we can show up to the campgrounds?**

    The campgrounds do not open until noon on Friday. **Do not** show up before that time. **Do not** line up on the side of the freeway.

* **What do we need before we can enter the campgrounds?**

    Tickets or ID. Screenshot/save the tickets prior to arrival since cell phone reception is spotty at best.

* **What if this is our first time to camp?**

    Let the gate volunteers/attendents know you're new to see if they have any advice or guidance. Ask questions, don't be shy.

* **Is there a burn ban?**
    
    - Ask Ray. He loves that.
    - There may also be a flag or symbol near the guard shack indicating that only Coleman/propane style lanterns, fire pits, stoves, burners, and alike are allowed. Open wood, charcoal, or any other type of fuel fires are not.

* **Where can I refill my propane?**

    Hwy 21 RV Park and Storage

* **Where is general camping?**

    1. Enter campgrounds
    2. At crossroads, turn left
        - On the right, there should be a large shield on a fence that says *Valhalla*.
        - **Do not** turn right since it's one-way traffic)
